            <h2>About this product</h2>
            <h3>What does it do? </h3>
            ScriptBasher breaks down your script into an excel spreadsheet showing scenes and sets.
            You can use the spreadsheet to work out what locations or set builds will be required.
            <h3>Who is it for? </h3>
            ScriptBasher is for producers and location managers or anyone who needs to work out the logistical requirements of a script.
            <h3>How do you use it? </h3>
            You simply upload the script, then you can view the different scenes each on a separate line.
            If you want it as an Excel sheet, you must enter your e-mail address below, click submit, and the script breakdown will be e-mailed to you.
            <h3>Our script is confidential - do you keep a copy?</h3>
            No we do not. We can guarantee that the only script data retained by us is what is contained in your breakdown.
            You get your breakdown e-mailed to you then all traces of the script itself disappear from our system.
            With your consent we retain your name and e-mail address,
            and we will be in touch in the future to let you know about other exciting digital products from Apply4 Technology.

            know how we can improve it and make it work for you. <br><br>
