            <h3>What does it do? </h3>
            ScriptBasher breaks down your script into an excel spreadsheet showing scenes and sets.
            You can use the spreadsheet to work out what locations or set builds will be required.
            <h3>Who is it for? </h3>
            ScriptBasher is for producers and location managers or anyone who needs to work out the logistical requirements of a script.
            <h3>How do you use it? </h3>
            You simply upload the script, then you can view the different scenes each on a separate line.
            If you want it as an Excel sheet, you must enter your e-mail address below, click submit, and the script breakdown will be e-mailed to you.
            <h3>Our script is confidential - do you keep a copy?</h3>
            No we do not. We can guarantee that the only script data retained by us is what is contained in your breakdown.
            You get your breakdown e-mailed to you then all traces of the script itself disappear from our system.
            With your consent we retain your name and e-mail address,
            and we will be in touch in the future to let you know about other exciting digital products from Apply4 Technology.

            <h3>This product does not work, my script breakdown is incomplete.</h3>
            Maybe! Currently it is only a prototype, so if it doesn't work as you'd expect it please let us
            know how we can improve it and make it work for you. <br><br>
            Our email is info@apply4.com. We look forward to hearing from you.
